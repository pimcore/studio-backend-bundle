  Update needs to have the complete data present. <br>
  You can create/update/delete list entries like metadata, custom settings and properties. <br> 
  E.g. if you want to remove an entry from metadata simply do not include this entry in the update. <br> 
  If you want to update only a single field, use the PATCH method.
